### Prototype

** NOTE: 't' is a unit of time **

### Description
Gridy provides the users a flexible and creative language, allowing them to create a grid-style game. Depending on how the user creates the game with Gridy, it may be a rhythm game or a whack-a-mole game or something completely new. 

Users can create a user-specified n x n grid and blocks, and set properties of the blocks (each square of the grid) such as the length of time they appear, color, key bindings, and points. Users can re-use the blocks they create and place them on the grid to appear at a specified time. Using a simple system of (x coordinate, y coordinate, time coordinate), users can also write functions to more easily create complex patterns for the appearance of blocks.

### Installation
You need to set up several libraries for Gridy to work:

* JavaFX (i.e., follow the instruction here to add the JavaFX library and set-up the VM: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html#create-project)
* Download and add the exp4j jar from https://www.objecthunter.net/exp4j/download.html
* Under `Edit Configurations...`, have `ui.GridyGame` selected as the Main class
* Make sure you've followed the VM steps from the JavaFX link above. In addition to the VM options inputted previously, add `,javafx.media` at the end as well. (i.e., `--module-path C:\Users\sample\Desktop\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media`)


### Running the Game
Refer to the Specs section below and its examples, then write your own Gridy game inside `input.tcts` file. Run the Game. If you have written the language correctly, a UI should appear. If not, an error will be returned on the console if Gridy fails to compile.

** IMPORTANT NOTE: <br/>
* All Cell, Function and Repeat objects must be a part of (i.e., included in) the Section to appear in a game.
* Thus, the game MUST include at least one Section object.
* Section is a portion of a game relative to time. For example, a minute long Gridy game might be divided into 2 Sections; one 20secs long Section, and one 40secs long Section. Or, it might be divided into two 30secs long Sections for example.

## Specs

* Language: Java 
* Fixed literal - capitalize
* User strings - no cap at the beginning

### EXAMPLES:

* Example 1:
```
// Create a 10x10, 60secs long game.
CreateGame(10, 10, 60);

// Create a Cell named 'full' that has a fade out time of 1 sec, is blue, and gives 25 points when clicked.
Cell full = CreateCell(1, blue, 25); 

// Create a Cell named 'half' that fades out after 0.5secs, is colour #ff6347, and gives 50 points when clicked.
Cell half = CreateCell(0.5, #ff6347, 50);

// Create a Repeat named 'repeatHalf' that shows a Cell named 'half' 5 times within 30secs.
Repeat repeatHalf = CreateRepeat(half, 5, 30); 

// Create a Function named 'f' that makes a Cell named 'halfCell' to move from top left corner to the top right corner.
Function f = CreateFunction(t % 10, 0, halfCell); 

// Create a Section named 'a' that is 60secs long. Remember, a Section object is required to add a Cell, Function, or a Repeat object to the game.
Section a = CreateSection(60); 

// To a Section named 'a', add a Repeat named 'repeatHalf' at Grid position (5,1). Start executing the Repeat object after 0secs from the beginning of Section 'a'.
a.Add(repeatHalf, 5, 1, 0); 

// To a Section named 'a', add a Cell named 'full' at Grid position (0,1). Have this Cell shown after 20secs from the beginning of Section 'a'.
a.Add(full, 0, 1,  20); 

// To a Section named 'a', add a Function named 'f'. Start executing the Function object after 5 secs from the beginning of Section 'a'.
a.Add(f, 5); 

// Insert a Section named 'a' to the game.
AddSection(a); 

// Increment the speed by a factor of 3.
Difficulty(3);
```
